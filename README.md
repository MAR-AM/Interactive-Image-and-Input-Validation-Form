# Interactive-Image-and-Input-Validation-Form
This HTML document features an image with a double-click event that shows an alert, and a button to remove this event listener. It also includes a text input field that validates a minimum length of 9 characters, changing the border color based on the input's validity. JavaScript manages the event listeners and validation.
